README for Dispersion Relation Solver Package
Copyright 2018 Ian Abel
==================================================================================

A framework for solving the kinds of dispersion relations that arise from slab
gyrokinetics and its close relatives.

WARNINGS
=================================================================================

1. These implementations have been only tested to moderate tolerances.
   It may not be possible to achieve machine precision with the current
   implementations.

2. The efficiency of these algorithms was *sufficient for the job at hand* when 
   they were first written. It is by no means the optimal implementation.

3. The build system, such as it is,  is a makefile. It is less portable than your
   average ten ton rock. It works on modern linux distributions, including 
   debian (buster or newer) and ubuntu. 

=================================================================================
What Now?
=================================================================================

If you have a functional C++ build environment, 'make' should produce the main
executable file 'DispSolver'. This is driven by an XML configuration file.

Example configurations files will be in the examples/ directory. 

Full documentation is in the docs/ subdirectory.

The licence and copying restrictions for this software is contained in the 
COPYING file.
