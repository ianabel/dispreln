README for Dispersion Relation Solver Package
Copyright 2018 Ian Abel
==================================================================================

A framework for solving the kinds of dispersion relations that arise from slab
gyrokinetics and its close relatives.

=================================================================================
WARNINGS
=================================================================================

1. These implementations have been only tested to moderate tolerances.
   It may not be possible to achieve machine precision with the current
   implementations.

2. The efficiency of these algorithms was *sufficient for the job at hand* when 
   they were first written. It is by no means the optimal implementation.

3. The build system, such as it is,  is a makefile. It is less portable than your
   average ten ton rock. It works on modern linux distributions, including 
   debian (buster or newer) and ubuntu. 

=================================================================================
What Now?
=================================================================================

There are several executables in this package for solving specific dispersion
relationships.

GKSlab: The full electromagnetic GK dispersion relation in an unsheared slab with
gradients of density and temperature for arbitrary species. The derivation of this
dispersion relation is included in LinearGK.tex

EdgeSlab: The linearisation of the reduced equations for a pedestal edge.
