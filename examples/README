Example 1

DriftWaveConfig.xml describes a two-species plasma containing ions and electrons, 
with density gradients but no temperature gradients. The file contains a simple
scan, where k_y is varied from 0.25 to 25, and the most unstable mode is tracked.

This example can be run by executing

./DispSolver -c DriftWaveConfig.xml

'ky-drift-wave-test' contains reference output for this configuration. 

The unstable mode in question is the electrostatic drift wave.
