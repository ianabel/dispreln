Project Plans
=======================

Physics:
	1) Add the bi-Maxwellian dispersion relation from Kunz et. al.
	2) Benchmark against gs2, include gs2 input files for comparison.

Root Finding:
	1) Add root-finding over a general polygonal domain, not just rectangles.
	2) Improve the direct solver to adaptively use higher-order methods than just
	the secant method.
	3) Multi-dimensional parameter scanning
	4) Improved root-tracking

Software
	1) Fully document the configuration file
	2) Write an XML schema or move to a different statically-analyzable configuration
	format. 
	3) Increase Test Coverage
